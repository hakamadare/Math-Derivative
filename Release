Uploaded to CPAN archives under my home directory.

Math::Derivative - Numeric 1st and 2nd order differentiation

This Perl package exports functions for performing numerical first
 and second order differentiation on data. They functions take
references to two arrays containing the x and y ordinates of the data
and return an array of the 1st or 2nd derivative at the given x
ordinates. The 2nd derivative may optionally be given values to use
for the first dervivative at the start and end points of the data -
otherwiswe 'natural' values are used.
